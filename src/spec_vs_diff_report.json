  "summary": "Most requested Code Status functionality appears implemented across backend (new CodeStatus variant + resident field + migration) and frontend (badge + dashboard/profile display + add/edit state). However, the diff also introduces unrequested audit/change-record structures and adds code status to a print report.",

    {
      "description": "Introduces a CodeStatusChangeRecord audit/change-history type for code status changes (and related fields) which is beyond the requested scope (no audit trail requirement).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for a persistent code status field with two values, migration, and UI controls/display; it does not request tracking or recording code status change events.",
