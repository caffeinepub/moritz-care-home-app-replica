  "summary": "REQ-4 appears implemented: ResidentProfilePage now includes a labeled Switch toggle near the Print button and the Print handler still calls window.print(). ResidentProfilePrintReport now accepts an includePhysicianSignature boolean prop, but the diff excerpt does not show the conditional print rendering of the physician name/signature blank area, nor the specific print CSS classes for the blank lines under @media print (content is truncated).",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "When the toggle is enabled, the print-only Resident Profile Report includes a dedicated area with blank lines for \"Physician's Name\" and \"Physician's Signature\"; when disabled, that area is not present anywhere in printed output.",
      "reason": "The diff shows ResidentProfilePrintReport accepts includePhysicianSignature, but the provided excerpt is truncated before any evidence of conditional rendering of the physician name/signature blank area (labels + blank lines) and its absence when disabled.",

      "reason": "frontend/src/index.css is truncated in the diff excerpt and does not show any new/modified print-specific classes for physician name/signature blank lines; therefore implementation cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
