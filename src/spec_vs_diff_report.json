  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3 appear implemented: a per-user backend preference `showResidentProfileReport` was added with migration defaulting to true; a Settings page toggle was added and wired to save/load the caller profile; and the Resident Profile page uses the preference to conditionally show report-related UI. However, several unrelated UI/boot/CSS changes were introduced that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to add a settings toggle to conditionally hide/show the Resident Profile Report; it explicitly states non-goals include not redesigning or changing layout/content beyond conditional hiding. These CSS changes affect many dialogs/components beyond the requested feature.",
