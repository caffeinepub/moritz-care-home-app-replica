  "summary": "Implemented a new shared MedicationSections component and integrated it into ResidentProfilePage to separate active vs discontinued medications. However, the diff does not show updates to the dedicated resident medications list view outside the profile page. Also includes unrelated print/report enhancements not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the resident medications UI (resident medications view) to display active and discontinued medications in separate labeled tables/sections, with discontinued medications view-only and an appropriate empty state when none exist.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a new MedicationSections component and updates to ResidentProfilePage, but does not show changes to any separate 'resident medications' page/view outside ResidentProfilePage. Additionally, the added component is truncated before showing the discontinued section, so the discontinued empty-state and view-only rendering for discontinued medications cannot be confirmed from the provided snippet alone.",
