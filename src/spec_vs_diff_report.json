  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence that the backend `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` behavior was updated to return promptly on missing/empty secrets or to preserve safe authorization semantics. The only clearly evidenced change outside backend code is an update to `project_state.json`, which was not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the backend implementation of the `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` call path so that when the provided secret token is missing/empty, the call returns promptly and does not hang or block actor initialization.",
      "reason": "The `backend/main.mo` snippet shown is unrelated (type definitions and profile/resident logic) and the diff summary provides no visible changes to `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret` or related access-control initialization logic. Because the file is truncated, the required change is not evidenced.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure invalid/empty secrets do not grant admin privileges and do not weaken existing authorization checks; valid token behavior remains unchanged.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows changes to secret validation, admin assignment, or authorization checks around `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret`. The truncated `backend/main.mo` content shown does not include this function/path.",
