  "summary": "The diff implements the requested boot-flow fix across backend and frontend: it relaxes backend authorization for boot-critical profile calls, makes access-control initialization non-blocking and optional (token-present only), improves BootErrorScreen diagnostics with collapsible error details, adds a Retry action that re-attempts boot without logout, and adjusts React Query keys/reset logic to avoid persistent cached boot errors across identities/retries.",
