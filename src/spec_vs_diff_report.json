  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by adding a dedicated class to the “Show Physician Signature Fields” switch on ResidentProfilePage and defining global CSS rules in index.css to set the switch thumb color to green when unchecked and white when checked, without modifying files under frontend/src/components/ui. However, the diff also includes substantial unrelated global styling changes (theme palette and global Radix surface enforcement) that were not requested and risk impacting other UI elements.",
