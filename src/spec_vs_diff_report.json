  "summary": "Diff adds a global CSS override in `frontend/src/index.css` forcing Radix dialog/popover/dropdown/select surfaces to be opaque and removes backdrop blur. Several modal `DialogContent` components were also updated to include a `dialog-solid-white` class. However, the dark-mode override forces a dark background instead of solid white, which conflicts with the requirement that dialogs remain solid white in both light and dark modes.",

      "requirement": "Every DialogContent panel must have a fully opaque solid white background (opacity 1) in both light and dark modes (no transparency/blur).",
      "reason": "`frontend/src/index.css` explicitly sets dark-mode Radix dialog content backgrounds to `oklch(20% 0.02 220)` (dark), not solid white, so dialogs will not be white in dark mode.",

      "reason": "`frontend/src/index.css` sets dark-mode Radix dropdown/select content backgrounds to a dark OKLCH color rather than solid white, so dropdown/select menus will not be white in dark mode.",

      "requirement": "Global styling safeguards must prevent dialog/dropdown/select/popover surfaces from becoming transparent, ensuring computed backgrounds are opaque solid white (no alpha channel) and opacity 1.",
      "reason": "The global safeguard in `frontend/src/index.css` enforces opacity 1 and removes blur, but in dark mode it enforces a dark background rather than the required solid white background.",
